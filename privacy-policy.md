This Privacy Policy explains how Savelon: Private Contacts (“the App”) handles information when you use it.

## 1) Summary

The App does not transmit your contacts or any encrypted data off your device. The only time any information leaves your device is if you _choose_ to use the optional in-app support form to send a message to us.

## 2) Information the App does not collect

The App is designed to work fully offline. We do not collect, transmit, sell, or share any of the following from the App as part of normal use:

- Your contacts list or contact details stored in the App
- Names, phone numbers, emails, addresses, notes, or other contact fields
- Encryption keys, passwords, or encrypted contact database contents
- Location data
- Advertising identifiers

## 3) Optional support messages (the only data we receive)

The App includes an optional support feature that allows you to contact us.

If you submit a support request, we may collect the following information that you voluntarily provide:

- Message content (required to describe your issue)
- Email address (optional, if you want a reply)
- Any other information you choose to include in your message

This information is used only to respond to your request and provide customer support.

## 4) How support data is collected and stored (Tally)

Support requests submitted through the App are collected using Tally ([https://tally.so](https://tally.so)). When you submit the support form, the data you enter is sent to and stored by Tally, and then accessed by us for support purposes.

Tally acts as a service provider (processor) for handling these submissions. Their processing of your data is governed by their terms and privacy practices.

## 5) Legal bases (EEA/UK users)

If you are located in the European Economic Area or the UK, we process your support submission data based on:

- Consent: when you choose to submit the support form and optionally provide your email
- Legitimate interests: responding to customer support inquiries and maintaining the App

## 6) Data retention

We retain support submissions only as long as needed to:

- Respond to you and resolve the issue
- Maintain records of support interactions for quality and continuity

If you want us to delete a support submission you sent, contact us using the details in Section 11.

## 7) Sharing of information

We do not sell your information.

We share support submission data only with:

- Tally, which stores and processes the support form submission
- Other service providers only if necessary to operate support workflows (for example, if you explicitly ask us to move the conversation to email), and only for support purposes

## 8) International transfers

Because Tally (and our own access to support submissions) may involve servers or access from different countries, your support submission data may be processed outside your country of residence. We take reasonable steps to use reputable providers and limit access to what is necessary for support.

## 9) Children’s privacy

The App is not directed to children under 13 (or the age defined by local law). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal data through the support form, contact us and we will take steps to delete it.

## 10) Your rights and choices

Depending on your location, you may have rights to:

- Request access to the personal data you submitted through support
- Request correction or deletion
- Object to or restrict certain processing

Because we generally do not collect data during normal App use, these rights mainly apply to information you voluntarily submit via the support form.

## 11) Contact

If you have questions or requests about this Privacy Policy or your support submission data, contact: [https://tally.so/r/jaZKA6](https://tally.so/r/jaZKA6)

## 12) Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will update the “Last updated” above. Continued use of the App after an update means you accept the updated policy.
