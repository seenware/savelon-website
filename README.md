# Savelon

Your contacts are people—family, friends, clients. They’re not just numbers.

Many apps ask for access to your address book. Sometimes that’s helpful. Sometimes it’s more than you want to share.

Not every contact belongs in your main phonebook. Savelon is a private vault for your important contacts—encrypted on your device, with no ads and no tracking.

**Available in App Store and Google Play soon.**
